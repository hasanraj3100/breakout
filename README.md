# 🎮 Breakout — Classic Arcade Remake in Lua (LÖVE 2D)

A modern remake of the classic **Breakout** game, built with **Lua** and **LÖVE 2D**.  
You control the paddle, bounce the ball, and smash through colorful bricks to rack up points!  
As you score higher, the paddle grows — but miss the ball, and it shrinks again. 😬

## ✨ Features
- Smooth paddle and ball controls  
- Score-based paddle resizing (grow with skill, shrink with mistakes)  
- Extra ball power-up (because one ball isn’t enough 😉)  
- Top 10 leaderboard — enter your name if you make it!  
- Classic retro feel recreated with LÖVE 2D

## 🧠 Background
This project was created as part of **Harvard’s Game Development course**.  
The core mechanics were taught in the course, and I extended it with:
- Paddle resizing logic  
- Multi-ball feature

## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Move the paddle using arrow keys 
2. Keep the ball from falling  
3. Destroy all the bricks to advance and score big!  
4. Make it to the top 10 and leave your mark on the leaderboard
